# App Store

Welcome to the App Store project! This project is a simple web application built using React.js that emulates an app store interface. You can explore various apps and search for your favorite ones. Let's dive into the features and functionality of this project.

## Features

### Tab Navigation

- The app provides a tab-based navigation system. You can switch between different categories of apps by clicking on the tabs.
- Initially, the **Social** tab is active, and it displays apps in the **Social** category.
- You can click on other tabs to switch to their respective categories.

### Search Functionality

- The App Store allows you to search for apps by name. Simply enter a search term in the search input, and the app list will update to display apps that match the search query.
- The search is case-insensitive, making it easy to find apps even if you don't remember the exact case of their names.
- When the search input is empty, the app list displays all the apps in the currently active category.

### Responsive Design

- The project is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. It provides a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `AppStore`: The main component that manages the tabs and displays the list of apps.
- `TabItem`: A reusable component for rendering individual tabs.
- `AppItem`: A reusable component for displaying information about each app.
